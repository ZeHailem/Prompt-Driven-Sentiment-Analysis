# Prompt-Driven Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates how to leverage large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis using prompt engineering, without training a custom model. By instructing the model with clear prompts, it can extract product type, brand, sentiment category, and the original feedback from user reviews.

## Features

- Uses [OpenAI GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o) via API for zero-shot sentiment analysis.
- Reads feedback from [`Data/feedback.txt`](Data/feedback.txt).
- Returns structured JSON with:
  - `product_type`
  - `brand`
  - `feedback_category` (positive or negative)
  - `original_feedback`
- FastAPI endpoint for easy integration.

## How It Works

1. The API reads each line of feedback from [`Data/feedback.txt`](Data/feedback.txt).
2. For each feedback, it sends a prompt to the LLM instructing it to analyze and extract relevant fields.
3. The model responds in JSON format, which is cleaned and parsed by [`Clean.clean_llm_response`](Clean.py).
4. Results are returned as a structured list.

## Example Prompt

```python
Analyze the following feedback and return response in JSON format with:
- product_type
- brand
- feedback_category (positive or negative)
- original_feedback
Feedback: "I love this Apple phone."
```

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requiremens.txt
    ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key:
    ```sh
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
    ```
3. Run the API    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
4. POST to `/analyze-feedback-file` to analyze all feedback.

## Why Prompt-Driven?

Prompt engineering allows you to use powerful LLMs for sentiment analysis and information extraction without custom training. By simply instructing the model, you can adapt to new tasks and domains quickly.
